    "Yes, you're correct! Since each new portfolio you construct could contain some assets that were in the previous one, technically, you are using sampling with replacement at the portfolio level. This means you would indeed be doing something akin to bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how this aligns with the concept of bootstrapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping in Your Context:\n",
    "Resampling with Replacement: In bootstrapping, you sample with replacement from the original data. In your case, you are randomly selecting assets to construct portfolios, and each portfolio has the possibility of including assets that appeared in previous portfolios. This is analogous to resampling with replacement, but instead of individual data points, you’re resampling groups of assets to form portfolios.\n",
    "Multiple Portfolios: Each portfolio is akin to a \"bootstrap sample.\" By generating multiple portfolios, you’re effectively creating a distribution of Sharpe ratios (or other performance metrics), which is what bootstrapping is designed to do—estimate the distribution of a statistic.\n",
    "Why This Is Bootstrapping:\n",
    "Randomized Selection: Just like in bootstrapping, you are drawing random samples from the asset pool to create each portfolio. Even though a particular asset might appear in one portfolio, it still has the chance to appear in another, which is what makes it with replacement.\n",
    "Repeated Sampling: By creating many portfolios and calculating the Sharpe ratio for each, you're building a distribution of Sharpe ratios. This distribution can then be used to estimate the overall performance of clustered portfolios, much like bootstrapping is used to estimate confidence intervals or distributions for a statistic.\n",
    "Portfolio Construction: Since you are constructing many portfolios in a repetitive manner, and assets can appear across multiple portfolios (but not duplicated within the same portfolio), you’re effectively bootstrapping the performance of the portfolios rather than bootstrapping individual data points directly.\n",
    "To Summarize:\n",
    "Yes, since you're drawing new random portfolios and each new portfolio can contain assets that were in previous portfolios, this is conceptually similar to bootstrapping.\n",
    "The process you're using fits the resampling with replacement model of bootstrapping, as the assets can appear across different portfolios.\n",
    "Your approach is valid and well-founded in statistical resampling methods like bootstrapping. By using this method, you're creating a robust estimate of portfolio performance across clusters, avoiding the reliance on any single portfolio configuration.\n",
